1
00:00:00.016 --> 00:00:03.007
The New York Housing Authority
is the largest land lord in North America.

2
00:00:03.019 --> 00:00:05.010
It houses 1 in 14 New Yorkers,

3
00:00:05.018 --> 0:00:09.007
and over 400,000 of those residents live
at campuses around New York City.

4
00:00:10.001 --> 00:00:13.020
We’re investing $3 billion to repair
damage from Hurricane Sandy

5
00:00:14.003 --> 00:00:15.012
and install resilience measures

6
00:00:15.016 --> 00:00:19.004
that are in line with the New York City Panel on
Climate Change and what their projections are.

7
00:00:20.014 --> 00:00:23.007
So this is a site plan of Coney Island Houses.

8
00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:26.028
The colored elements are the resilience elements
that we’re installing as part of the project.

9
00:00:27.017 --> 00:00:29.026
At Coney Island Houses, Sandy knocked out

10
00:00:30.003 --> 00:00:33.001
the electrical systems, the
mechanical systems and the boilers

11
00:00:33.003 --> 00:00:35.004
which were in the basement of
the building right behind me.

12
00:00:35.024 --> 00:00:38.001
What we’re doing now is we want
to protect this development

13
00:00:38.003 --> 00:00:40.028
so the residents don’t have to worry
about that happening ever again.

14
00:00:42.001 --> 00:00:45.022
What that means is raising all of the
critical infrastructure for the buildings—

15
00:00:45.024 --> 00:00:47.023
the electricity, the heat and hot water—

16
00:00:47.027 --> 00:00:50.003
well above the design flood elevation.

17
00:00:50.013 --> 00:00:54.003
And also being forward looking,
accounting for 2.5 feet of sea-level rise.

18
00:00:56.009 --> 00:00:59.029
One other piece of resilient infrastructure
that’s being installed at this development

19
00:01:00.008 --> 00:01:01.019
is roof-top generators.

20
00:01:02.008 --> 00:01:04.022
These generators will provide full back-up power.

21
00:01:04.024 --> 00:01:08.010
That means that residents in these buildings will be
protected from any power outage in the future.

22
00:01:09.002 --> 00:01:12.011
It’s also going to allow NYCHA to enroll
these buildings in Demand Response.

23
00:01:12.028 --> 00:01:15.011
Demand Response is a program utilities have

24
00:01:15.015 --> 00:01:18.006
so that if there’s a very hot day and
everybody’s using their air conditioners,

25
00:01:18.014 --> 00:01:20.021
they can ask NYCHA to take these buildings off the grid.

26
00:01:20.028 -->  00:01:22.012
The buildings will still have their full power.

27
00:01:22.029 -->  00:01:26.008
And then the grid will have a little more
capacity for the other folks in the neighborhood.

28
00:01:27.015 --> 00:01:30.020
So these are commitments the Agency
is making because it’s recognizing that

29
00:01:30.022 --> 00:01:33.023
climate change is going to impact
how the Agency does business

30
00:01:33.026 --> 00:01:35.023
It’s going to impact how our residents live their lives.

31
00:01:36.002 --> 00:01:38.009
And we want to make sure that buildings are prepared

32
00:01:38.011 --> 00:01:39.020
to withstand these changes.
