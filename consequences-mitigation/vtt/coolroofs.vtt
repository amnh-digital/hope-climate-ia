00:00:00.016 --> 00:00:02.000
The "urban heat island effect"

2
00:00:02.010 --> 00:00:04.021
affects a lot of cities like New York,

3
00:00:05.003 --> 00:00:06.022
because a tremendous amount of buildings,

4
00:00:06.026 --> 00:00:07.024
a lot of concrete,

5
00:00:08.004 --> 00:00:09.006
and little vegetation

6
00:00:09.011 --> 00:00:11.010
increases the overall temperature of the city.

7
00:00:12.001 --> 00:00:14.027
And when the city is really, really, really hot,

8
00:00:15.014 --> 00:00:17.002
it affects the health of our citizens:

9
00:00:17.006 --> 00:00:19.017
individuals who may suffer from asthma

10
00:00:19.023 --> 00:00:21.026
or may be susceptible to heat waves,

11
00:00:22.002 --> 00:00:23.013
our elderly population.

12
00:00:24.004 --> 00:00:27.003
So heat actually affects life and safety.

13
00:00:28.008 --> 00:00:31.010
One of the strategies that we have to
combat the urban heat island effect

14
00:00:31.020 --> 00:00:33.017
is the NYC CoolRoofs initiative,

15
00:00:33.026 --> 00:00:36.026
which works simply by painting the roofs white.

16
00:00:37.005 --> 00:00:39.003
"See how the coating is going inside the seams?
"Yeah."

17
00:00:39.010 --> 00:00:40.026
Put it on as heavy as you can get it."

18
00:00:41.016 --> 00:00:44.021
Many buildings, because of
the black roof, absorb heat.

19
00:00:44.027 --> 00:00:48.021
And painting them white reduces the
internal temperature of a building

20
00:00:49.001 --> 00:00:50.016
by 10 to 30 percent.

21
00:00:50.018 --> 00:00:52.003
"Remember guys, don't stretch the coating,

22
00:00:52.005 --> 00:00:53.001
don't stretch the coating.

23
00:00:53.003 --> 00:00:53.021
Where's your bucket?"

24
00:00:53.023 --> 00:00:56.004
That reflective coating's going to keep the building cooler,

25
00:00:56.011 --> 00:00:58.012
conserve energy for the people who live in the building.

26
00:00:59.006 --> 00:01:01.016
Less air conditioning and less fans being run.

27
00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:03.012
People can save some money.

28
00:01:04.001 --> 00:01:05.008
Very energy efficient.

29
00:01:05.019 --> 00:01:06.026
"You can't get thatâ€¦"

30
00:01:07.008 --> 00:01:09.001
This CoolRoofs program is really

31
00:01:09.007 --> 00:01:15.020
a part of the Mayor's strategy to lower
New York City's emissions by 80 percent by 2050,

32
00:01:15.024 --> 00:01:20.000
and to really help New York City become
a great partner in fighting climate change.
