00:00:00.006 --> 00:00:03.008
In the United States,
not a lot of people ride public transportation-

2
00:00:03.017 --> 00:00:05.001
In fact, about 2%.

3
00:00:05.020 --> 00:00:08.018
Whereas in the city of New York, it's almost 66%.

4
00:00:09.013 --> 00:00:12.011
This has very clear climate benefits.

5
00:00:13.003 --> 00:00:17.001
And therefore, there's some irony
in the fact that the MTA is also

6
00:00:17.009 --> 00:00:20.005
heavily and adversely impacted by climate change,

7
00:00:20.013 --> 00:00:23.026
because our trains and subways run under the ground,

8
00:00:24.004 --> 00:00:27.002
where water and storms and
floods can reach very quickly.

9
00:00:28.005 --> 00:00:30.028
This is a new reality.
This is not something we can ignore.

10
00:00:31.017 --> 00:00:36.026
So we have had to build this into existing
projects, as well as new projects.

11
00:00:37.004 --> 00:00:40.005
For instance, around Lower Manhattan station entrances,

12
00:00:40.014 --> 00:00:46.000
many of these now have steel doors that can
take 10, 12 feet of standing water above them.

13
00:00:46.007 --> 00:00:48.017
We have completed reinforcing

14
00:00:48.021 --> 00:00:49.025
manhole covers,

15
00:00:49.027 --> 00:00:50.260
maintenance hatches.

16
00:00:51.004 --> 00:00:54.021
We have devised ways to raise air vents,

17
00:00:54.280 --> 00:00:59.060
so that even if there's standing water on the
street, it won't actually go into the system.

18
00:00:59.023 --> 00:01:02.005
Responding to climate change is not going to go away.

19
00:01:02.016 --> 00:01:04.023
It has to be baked into everything we do

20
00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:06.014
for the foreseeable future.
