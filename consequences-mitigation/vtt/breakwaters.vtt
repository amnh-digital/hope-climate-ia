00:00:01.010 --> 00:00:03.027
When we talk about climate
change and coastal risk,

2
00:00:04.009 --> 00:00:06.026
very often people really worry about flooding.

3
00:00:08.003 --> 00:00:10.008
But in places like Staten Island,

4
00:00:10.016 --> 00:00:12.014
risk is also about storm waves

5
00:00:12.024 --> 00:00:14.022
and coastal erosion.

6
00:00:18.017 --> 00:00:24.003
Living Breakwaters is a coastal resilience
project offshore of Tottenville, State Island.

7
00:00:24.026 --> 00:00:27.021
And it’s designed to reduce
wave heights and energy,

8
00:00:27.023 --> 00:00:29.029
and help control shoreline erosion.

9
00:00:32.001 --> 00:00:35.013
The overall layout and design
of the Living Breakwaters

10
00:00:35.015 --> 00:00:38.023
was developed through
a pretty complex modeling process.

11
00:00:40.002 --> 00:00:42.019
We had to test how they worked.

12
00:00:42.026 --> 00:00:45.028
Would they attenuate waves
coming from different directions?

13
00:00:46.007 --> 00:00:47.026
Would they build the beach back?

14
00:00:50.011 --> 00:00:52.026
One of the most exciting
parts about the project

15
00:00:52.028 --> 00:00:55.008
is it isn’t just designed
to be about risk reduction;

16
00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:56.029
it’s about creating habitat.

17
00:00:58.004 --> 00:01:00.008
This area used to have oyster reefs.

18
00:01:00.010 --> 00:01:05.018
And shells and reef create this complex
habitat with lots of niches and crevices.

19
00:01:05.022 --> 00:01:09.011
And the breakwaters are designed
to have that complexity, too.

20
00:01:11.014 --> 00:01:14.020
One of the key intents of the Living Breakwaters

21
00:01:14.022 --> 00:01:16.020
is that it’s not just this project.

22
00:01:17.001 --> 00:01:19.018
It’s going to work differently in different places,

23
00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:22.001
but we really hope that many of the techniques

24
00:01:22.002 --> 00:01:24.013
piloted and used in the breakwaters

25
00:01:24.018 --> 00:01:26.029
can be replicable in other communities.
