00:00:00.014 --> 00:00:03.000
Yeah, Sandy wasâ€¦huh.

2
00:00:04.020 --> 00:00:06.021
It was one of those things you never want to do again.

3
00:00:07.014 --> 00:00:10.011
Our business was hit hard by the storm.
We're right here in Rockaway.

4
00:00:10.013 --> 00:00:14.017
And just searching on the Internet to help
my business, I came across the RISE contest

5
00:00:14.020 --> 00:00:17.020
run by the New York City Economic
Development Corporation.

6
00:00:17.028 --> 00:00:21.007
And the purpose was to find
new technologies that would make

7
00:00:21.011 --> 00:00:25.002
businesses that were affected by
Superstorm Sandy more resilient.

8
00:00:26.008 --> 00:00:28.013
Solatube is a daylighting device.

9
00:00:29.001 --> 00:00:30.003
It's installed on the roof.

10
00:00:30.017 --> 00:00:31.019
The dome captures the light.

11
00:00:32.012 --> 00:00:35.008
The light is transferred down
through a highly reflective tube.

12
00:00:35:10 --> 00:00:38:03
And a diffuser spreads the
light out evenly in the room.

13
00:00:39.004 --> 00:00:42.003
My proposal was that I could
take 40 local businesses,

14
00:00:42.017 --> 00:00:43.015
daylight them,

15
00:00:43.019 --> 00:00:45.011
thereby saving them electricity,

16
00:00:45.017 --> 00:00:47.009
less strain on the power grid,

17
00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:51.000
and providing a safety factor for them
in case of future blackouts.

18
00:00:53.008 --> 00:00:56.003
The way the tubes are designed,
they fit right through the roof rafters.

19
00:00:56.005 --> 05 00:00:57.007
There's different sizes.

20
00:00:57.009 --> 00:00:58.023
And they're used all over the world.

21
00:00:59.026 --> 00:01:01.023
We do get a lot of blackouts in this area.

22
00:01:02.022 --> 00:01:05.014
The grid here in Rockaway, and probably
in a lot of other areas in the city,

23
00:01:05.017 --> 00:01:07.009
they're old and they're overtaxed.

24
00:01:07.029 --> 00:01:09.011
So if we do have a blackout,

25
00:01:09.013 --> 00:01:12.001
the businesses can operate
and not worry about the lighting.

26
00:01:12.027 --> 00:01:13.015
It's simple.

27
00:01:13.018 --> 00:01:15.014
You put a dome up, you capture the light,

28
00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:16.029
it sends it into the building.

29
00:01:17.006 --> 00:01:20.009
I've had many people say:
"Oh, I had that idea ten years ago."

30
00:01:20.011 --> 00:01:22.016
And you know, the best things are simple.
