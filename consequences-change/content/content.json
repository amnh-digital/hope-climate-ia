Formed from melting ice, the liquid water digs deep holes into the ice sheet, allowing the water to drain to the bottom of the ice sheet and into the ocean.",

It has retreated more than 2.5 miles (4 kilometers) during the past 16 years. Neumayer flows into the ocean; even a tiny change in ocean temperature significantly affects the amount of heat available to melt the glacier.",
